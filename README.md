Based on the sonic bikes setup, but using Pure Data for live
sonification, and addition of new sensors for citizen science data
collection purposes:

* Thermometer
* Air pollution (particulate matter)
* Custom turbidity sensor
* Hydrophone

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/fo-am/sonic-kayaks/wiki) for full documentation on how to build a Sonic Kayak.
