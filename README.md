Sonic Kayak
===========

Originally based on the [Sonic Bikes](https://github.com/sonicbikes/)
system, a Raspberry Pi based citizen science project where kayaks
become musical & scientific instruments for investigating the marine
world.

We've added new sensors for citizen science data collection purposes:

* Thermometer
* Air pollution (particulate matter)
* Custom turbidity sensor
* Hydrophone

The system uses Pure Data for live audio sonification.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/fo-am/sonic-kayaks/wiki) for full documentation on how to build a Sonic Kayak.
